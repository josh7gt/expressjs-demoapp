# Hello! Welcome to my first repository.
This is a demo web project built through the use of Express JS. In this project, I'll be exploring a bunch of key web development processes and will soon build my own web project.

* [x] Various request types configured
* [x] Use of middleware functions
* [ ] Validation
* [ ] Routers

This demo web project follows [this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH9E25nkk3I) by Anson. I highly recommend this course if you are interested in web development with Express JS.
